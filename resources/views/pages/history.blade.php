                                            Meglink started as a small interior design outlet studio in 2008,
                                            focusing on residential projects and developing a niche in
                                            personalized home design.
                                            The company gained recognition for delivering detailed and
                                            bespoke solutions in kitchens, wardrobes, and cabinets. By 2011,
                                            we had established a modest but loyal client base, relying heavily
                                            on word-of-mouth recommendations.

                                        <p>As demand grew, Meglink expanded its service portfolio to include
                                            office partitioning, floor finishing, and custom cabinetry.
                                            The team grew to 10 professionals, and new roles such as project
                                            managers and design assistants were added to streamline operations.
                                            During this period, Meglink also secured its first major commercial
                                            contract, marking its transition from a purely residential focus.
